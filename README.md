# PHP-Utils-Demo

Demo for [PHP-Utils](https://github.com/athill/PHP-Utils)

[Current Demo](http://demo.andyhill.us/)

This, like PHP-Utils, is a work in progress. Like PHP-Utils, I'm building things as I need them. For example, I wanted to verify nested directories are handled properly, so there are nested directories. I also want to convert some sites I'm already responsible for to this paradigm, so development in some areas before others may reflect that as well. 

That said, I'm hoping to create a simpler demo at some point, but currently this suits my needs. For this demo, you need either [Laravel Homestead](http://laravel.com/docs/4.2/homestead), or to install Composer and Node.js and then Bower and Gulp.js. Once you have these requirements, you should be able to run the following commands and then view the demo:


	$ composer update
	$ npm install
	$ bower install
	$ gulp
